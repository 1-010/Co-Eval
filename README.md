# Co-Eval: Conversational Evaluation Prototype

Co-Eval is a conversational protocol for evaluating human-AI interaction not by performance, but by structure, reasoning, and evolution over time.

This repository contains a submission-ready example of a Co-Eval-based report, created collaboratively between Hidenari Sasaki and GPT-4o.  
It also preserves the iterative outputs from early-stage prototyping via GPTs, highlighting how conversational design itself can become evaluative evidence.

## Repository Structure

- `HidenariSasaki_Co-Eval_2025_Submission.txt`: Final Co-Eval report with SHA-256 integrity hash. Intended for evaluation and submission.
- `What_is_Co-Eval.md`: Introduction to the Co-Eval design philosophy, its use in interview contexts, and its proposed structural benefits.
- `sandbox/`: Historical outputs generated during early GPTs prototyping.  
  These include test reports, partial fragments, and exploration attempts. Retained as structural context.

## How to Use

- If you're reviewing this as part of an application:  
  Begin with `What_is_Co-Eval.md`, then read `HidenariSasaki_Co-Eval_2025_Submission.txt`.

- If you're exploring Co-Eval as a design method:  
  Use the `sandbox/` folder to understand the generative process behind it. These artifacts show the structure-formation journey in action.

- For deeper discussion or collaboration:

Co-Eval was born from a simple idea:  
> What if evaluation could be less performative, and more observable?

## Co-Eval GPTs (Experimental)

We’ve also created an experimental GPT instance for Co-Eval:  
[→ Try Co-Eval GPTs here](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-682e3f04d4d481919c074a98fa11ad8d)

It was designed to generate Co-Eval Reports in real-time via ChatGPT's GPTs platform.  
**Note:** Due to GPTs platform limitations, it may behave unpredictably or produce underwhelming output—this is not reflective of the full Co-Eval potential seen in this repository.

That said, it remains a living prototype—feel free to experiment, adapt, or fork it.
